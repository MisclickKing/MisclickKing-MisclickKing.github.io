            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This site will be an overhaul of my <a href="https://www.garmentsofmovement.com" target="_blank">mother's current business website</a>. Due to some 
                troubles with her last website host, my mom has asked if I would design her website to include the 
                designs and funcitons she is looking for. Her site is a promotion of her hand made garments, made for 
                dancers who do ministry at church and church events. Her products include premade garments and custom 
                ones per the client's request. The site is aimed at people who do dance ministry, regaurdless of age or 
                experience levels. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The site will contain a variety of content, including a logo, an introduction to the site, a newletter sign up, 
                a contact section, a store front page with a list of products, and a gallary of images from past sells 
                and events, among other things. I plan to update this site beyond the scope of this assingnment as well.

            <div>
                <h4>Home Page</h4>
                <p>
                    This is an introduction to the main site and what it is about. Customers or those 
                    who happen upon the site will find the title, logo, image of the owner of the site, and 
                    a series of branching links to futher explore the site. This page will have hyperlinks and 
                    a navagation bar. This page is a show and tell intro without specail functions.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Shop All</h4>
                <p>
                    This webpage will have a list of images/products for sale, as well as an in or out of stock 
                    subtext for the product. It will give you the option of check out and a final price listing 
                    at the cart, assumping I get that far in the overall process of being about to make a purchase
                    within the site.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h4>Gallery</h4>
                <p>
                    A series of images of previous works and events, as well as specific sections for gender and age 
                    related product viewings. Haven't fully commited to how I want to display these images yet, but I 
                    do want them to maximize to full size when clicked on.
                </p> 
            </div>    
            <div>
                <h4>Newletter</h4>
                <p>
                    This section will have news on current or upcoming products and/or events for the customer to partake 
                    in. This includes sales and live evetns where the owner might set up a booth for product sales. There 
                    will also be a newsletter sign up for getting these newsletter directly sent to your email. This will 
                    include a sign up sheet with a require email address.

            <div>
                <h4>Contact</h4>
                <p>
                    This part of the site is for contacting the owner directly for custom orders, questions, or general 
                    communications. This section will require filling in information, such as an first and last name, email, 
                    and a message for the owner to read.
                </p>

            <h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
            <p>
                I want to incorperate a sense of movement throughout the website. I want to achieve this through 
                small details such as scroll images in gallery and moving UI elements. This was best demonstrated 
                by the site I used as a good example of webdesign in a previous assignment early on in the semester.

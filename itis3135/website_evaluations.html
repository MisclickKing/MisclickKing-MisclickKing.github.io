				<p style="text-indent: 25px; width: 500px; margin-left: 25px;">
					Lets get the bad out of the way first. This website is a self promoting 
					site of the comedian named Bob Saget. It gives the viewer a discription 
					of the man's works, links to his many socials, and a bunch of pictures of 
					him standing in place making the exact same facial expression. 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>C</b>ontrast: The contrast varies for the most part. Most of the text
						is white set against a mostly dark grey background, which works well. However 
						there are areas where the same white text is placed in front of a white or light 
						blue background, which makes you squint to read it. 
					</li>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>R</b>epetition: The site repeats the same color schemes of grey and white, as 
						well as large rectangular shapes for images and text layout. However the size of these 
						rectangles and the spacing of them (or lack thereof) create a very tight and uncomfortable
						feeling when trying to navigate the site. Not to mention a lot of 'white space' is created 
						near the top and bottom of the site because of this.  
					</li>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>A</b>lignment: Nothing is truly aligned properly on this site. Pictures and lumps of 
						text feel thrown together without a care as to how it relates to or effects one another. 
					</li>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>P</b>roximity: The site is broken up into three main pieces excluding the navigation area
						at the top. However, the content barely as room to breath as these parts are so close to one 
						another. Even within these three sections, the text and pictures are either too close together 
						or generated too much 'white space' to justify the formatting choice. 
					</li>
				</ul>

                <h3 style="text-indent: 25px;"><a href="https://www.chiaraluzzana.com" target="_blank">Chiara Luzzana</a></h3>
				<p style="text-indent: 25px; width: 500px; margin-left: 25px;">
					Now for the good. This site is another self promoting site of a musical artist named Chiara Luzzana. 
					The site as a whole is minimal, easy to navigate, and is accompanied by a wonderful looping track. The
					site links to her works, socails, and introduction. 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>C</b>ontrast: The site has a beautiful two tone contrast. It uses what I believe is a cream color 
						with a hint of pink, and a very dark brown being closer to black. Transitions to differnent elements 
						of the site will change the dominate presence of the two colors (e.g. dark brown background with cream color 
						text and vise versa). 
					</li>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>R</b>epetition: The site has a lot of repeating shapes fonts styles. Rectangles and squares are used 
						for pictures and navigation in certain areas. Larger text has a distint font compared to the smaller text, 
						which makes it easier to naviagate the site and its more specific elements.
					</li>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>A</b>lignment: Everything aligns well, keeping text and images to certain parts of the screen where 
						they are relevant and easily displayed. The site even plays with this alignment and encourages you to line 
						up certain pictures while you scroll through. 
					</li>
					<li style="width: 475px; margin-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 12px;">
						<b>P</b>roximity: Every element of this site is spaced out far enough from each other that it is easy to find 
						and read the text where relevant, while being close enough to where nothing feels out of place either.  
					</li>
